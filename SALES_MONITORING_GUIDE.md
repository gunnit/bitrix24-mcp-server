# Sales Team Monitoring Guide

This guide provides comprehensive examples and use cases for the new sales monitoring tools in the Bitrix24 MCP Server.

## 🎯 Overview

The sales monitoring tools allow you to track and analyze your sales team's performance across multiple dimensions:
- **User Activities**: Calls, emails, timeline interactions, response times
- **Performance Metrics**: Deal conversion rates, revenue generation, activity ratios
- **Account Management**: Track all interactions with specific customers
- **Team Comparisons**: Compare performance across team members
- **Deal Progression**: Monitor deals through pipeline stages
- **Forecasting**: Predict future performance based on historical data
- **User Management**: Identify users by name instead of just IDs for human-readable reports

## 👥 User Management & Identification

Before diving into sales monitoring, it's crucial to understand who your users are. The user management tools help you identify users by name instead of just seeing cryptic user IDs.

### Getting User Information

```bash
# Get all users in the system
Get all users in the system with their names and details

# Get specific user information
Get user information for user ID 123

# Resolve multiple user IDs to names
Resolve user IDs [123, 456, 789] to user names
```

### Enhanced Data with User Names

All monitoring tools now provide enhanced data that includes user names alongside IDs:

```bash
# Get contacts with user names resolved
Get contacts with user names resolved showing who created, modified, or is assigned to each contact

# Get deals with user names resolved
Get deals with user names resolved showing assigned users, creators, and modifiers by name

# Get leads with user names resolved
Get leads with user names resolved with complete user information

# Get companies with user names resolved
Get companies with user names resolved showing all user relationships
```

**Benefits of User Name Resolution:**
- **Human-Readable Reports**: See "John Smith" instead of "User ID 123"
- **Better Team Understanding**: Quickly identify who's responsible for what
- **Improved Accountability**: Clear ownership visibility
- **Enhanced Analytics**: More meaningful performance comparisons

### User Fields Enhanced

When you use any monitoring tool, you'll now see enhanced fields like:
- `ASSIGNED_BY_ID: "123"` → `ASSIGNED_BY_ID_NAME: "John Smith"`
- `CREATED_BY_ID: "456"` → `CREATED_BY_ID_NAME: "Maria Garcia"`
- `MODIFY_BY_ID: "789"` → `MODIFY_BY_ID_NAME: "Robert Johnson"`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues

1. **No data returned**: Check date ranges and ensure there's activity in the specified period
2. **User ID not found**: Verify user IDs using the user management tools
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure webhook has appropriate CRM and activity permissions
4. **Rate limiting**: The system automatically handles rate limiting, but large queries may take time

### Best Practices

1. **Start with recent data**: Use shorter date ranges for initial analysis
2. **Focus on specific metrics**: Don't try to analyze everything at once
3. **Regular monitoring**: Set up regular monitoring schedules
4. **Combine tools**: Use multiple tools together for comprehensive analysis
