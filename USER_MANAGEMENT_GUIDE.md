# User Management Guide

This guide explains how to use the new user management tools in the Bitrix24 MCP Server to identify users by name instead of just IDs, making your CRM data more human-readable and meaningful.

## üéØ Overview

The user management tools solve a common problem in CRM systems: seeing cryptic user IDs instead of actual names. These tools allow you to:

- **Identify Users**: Get actual names instead of just numeric IDs
- **Resolve User References**: Convert user IDs to readable names in bulk
- **Enhance CRM Data**: Automatically add user names to contacts, deals, leads, and companies
- **Improve Reporting**: Generate more meaningful reports with actual user names

## üë• Core User Management Tools

### 1. Get Individual User Information

Retrieve detailed information about a specific user by their ID.

```bash
# Get specific user details
Get user information for user ID 123

# Example response includes:
# - ID: "123"
# - NAME: "John"
# - LAST_NAME: "Smith"
# - EMAIL: "john.smith@company.com"
# - WORK_POSITION: "Sales Manager"
# - ACTIVE: "Y"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Verify user details before assignments
- Get contact information for team members
- Check user status and permissions

### 2. Get All Users in System

Retrieve a complete list of all users with their names and details.

```bash
# Get all users
Get all users in the system with their names and details

# Get all users including inactive ones
Get all users in the system including inactive users
```

**Key Information Provided:**
- Full name (first + last)
- Email address
- Work position/title
- Active status
- Department information
- Contact details

### 3. Resolve Multiple User IDs to Names

Convert multiple user IDs to readable names in a single operation.

```bash
# Resolve multiple user IDs
Resolve user IDs [123, 456, 789, 101] to user names

# Example response:
# {
#   "123": "John Smith",
#   "456": "Maria Garcia",
#   "789": "Robert Johnson",
#   "101": "Sarah Wilson"
# }
```

**Benefits:**
- Efficient bulk resolution
- Perfect for processing lists of user IDs

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Start with User Directory

Always begin by understanding your user base:

```bash
# Get complete user directory
Get all users in the system with their names and details
```

### 2. Use Consistent Naming

When working with user IDs, consistently use the enhanced tools:

```bash
# Instead of: Get latest deals
# Use: Get deals with user names resolved
```

### 3. Combine with Filtering

Use user names for better filtering:

```bash
# Find deals for specific user
Get deals with user names resolved with filter {"ASSIGNED_BY_ID": "123"}
```

### 4. Regular User Updates

Keep user information current:

```bash
# Regularly check user directory
Get all users in the system with their names and details
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **User ID not found**: The system gracefully handles missing users by showing "User [ID]"
2. **Inactive users**: Include inactive users in searches if needed
3. **Permission issues**: Ensure webhook has user access permissions
4. **Rate limiting**: User resolution is optimized but large datasets may take time

### Error Handling

The system automatically handles:
- Missing user IDs
- Inactive users
- Permission restrictions
- API rate limits

### Performance Tips

1. **Batch operations**: Use bulk resolution for multiple IDs
2. **Filtered queries**: Use filters to reduce data volume
3. **Specific fields**: Request only needed user information
4. **Caching**: User information is cached for efficiency
